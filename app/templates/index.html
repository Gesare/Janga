                    Floods are an area of study of the discipline hydrology and are of significant concern in agriculture, civil engineering and public health.
                    Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river, lake, or ocean, in which the water overtops or breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries,[2] or it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood.

                    An earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth's <br>
                    lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt to those violent enough to propel objects and people into the air, and wreak destruction across entire cities.

                     landslide is defined as the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth down a slope. Landslides are a type of "mass wasting," which denotes any down-slope movement of soil and rock under the direct influence of gravity. 
                     The term "landslide" encompasses five modes of slope movement: falls, topples, slides, spreads, and flows.
